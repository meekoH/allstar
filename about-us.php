                        <p>In 2003 Tom Anastopoulos, the Founder and President of the AllStar Group of Companies, was lamenting over supper one night that there didn’t appear to be any really great place for wings. Coincidentally, the dinner Tom was serving was ribs. Everyone loved Tom’s ribs! So while the dinner time discussions revolved around wings, it was quickly decided that Tom’s excellent ribs should also be a staple of a daring, new business. And so AllStar Wings &amp; Ribs<sup>®</sup> was born! It was an instant success! It soon became evident that the success came as a result of careful planning and meticulous execution of the concept. Tom was sensitive to the fact that customers demand value and value meant quality product, fair price, great service and a convenient location.</p>

                        <!-- <p>Location was, and still is one of AllStar’s’ keys to success. The first location was located in Markham, Ontario. It was a relatively small location of only 2,500 square feet and offered 40 seats. Sales approached $1 million that first year. Success continued and the business kept growing. In the beginning of the third year, Richmond Hill’s Elgin Mills location opened with a bang. Sales numbers in the first year hit levels that even big restaurants with 200 seats have difficulty approaching. In December 2009, AllStar opened its state-of-the-art “Flag Ship” restaurant and Head Office facilities on Rutherford Road in Vaughn, Ontario with sales exceeding all expectations.</p> -->

                        <p>Product in the restaurant business is of paramount importance. So with AllStar the quality of the product that is served and the uniqueness of the service give AllStar Wings &amp; Ribs<sup>®</sup> Restaurants a distinct advantage over competition. Since its inception AllStar has focused on the quality that made the initial success possible.  The combination of 180 flavours of wings to choose from, a “to-die-for” selection of meaty ribs, great service from a highly trained wait staff and an overall fun atmosphere continues to make new locations follow the successes enjoyed by earliest ones.</p>

                        <p>For families, kids, fun-minded singles, adults and seniors looking for fun, cool atmosphere with great food and excellent service, AllStar Wings &amp; Ribs<sup>®</sup> delivers on all fronts. Recognizable by its multi-flagged logo, unique interior colours and multitudes of televisions and sports memorabilia on the walls, AllStar has quickly gained a reputation as an outstanding themed restaurant that delivers GREAT wings &amp; ribs, great value, abundant portions and a memorable dining experience. AllStar Wings &amp; Ribs<sup>®</sup> attention to detail and uncompromising commitment to quality has created a compelling image with customers in the marketplace – thereby occupying a unique position in the foodservice industry.</p>
